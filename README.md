Don't let the samurais get you!

How to play:
Use the arrows to move around, press up to jump (and again to doublejump).
Throw shurikens with spacebar.
Don't touch samurais, and dodge falling arrows from the sky to stay alive. 

Defeat as many samurais as you can, and stay alive for as long as you can.
Beware, this gets really hard, really fast!
If you're able to defeat 100 samurais, you are a TRUE ninja!
